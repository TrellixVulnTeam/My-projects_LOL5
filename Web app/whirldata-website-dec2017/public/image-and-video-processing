			<p>Image/Video Processing was/is predominantly considered to be a
				set of advanced signal processing algorithms applied to
				images/videos to convert them to a state whereby inferences can be
				made from them for various purposes.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>
				Computer Vision, on the other hand, usually refers to the science of
				extracting meaningful information from images/videos (usually
				processed through various image/video processing techniques) which
				solves a well-defined business case. Computer Vision is used to
				solve “Hard” problems – problems for which well-defined algorithms
				cannot provide precise mathematical solutions in an acceptable time
				period. <br> <br>
			<p>Machine Learning (Deep Learning), today, is capable of
				replacing some Image Processing requirements and can solve a larger
				set of Computer Vision problems. However, a careful selection of
				tools and algorithms are required to solve any problem within a time
				and at a cost which is relevant for the commercial problem on hand.
			</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Whirldata works with customers to understand the
				time-cost-accuracy trade-off and various other factors that may
				impact the nature of the solution. Once this understanding is clear,
				various carefully chosen combinations of image processing and
				feature extraction methods are used to develop a ground-up solution.
			</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Whirldata's team is capable of traditional image/video
				processing approaches such as Scale Invariant Feature Tranformation
				(SIFT), Harris Corner Detection/Transformations, Speed Up Robust
				Feature(SURF), Oriented Fast Rotated Brief (ORB) and several others.
				In addition, Whirldata has extensively used Convoluted Neural
				Networks and various deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture
				based tools like SegNet to evaluate time-cost-accuracy trade-offs
				for different commercial scenarios. In addition, every developer is
				proficient with Python (with numpy) and C++ and between the team a
				significant amount of knowledge base is available for calculus,
				liner algebra, probability and statistics.</p>
