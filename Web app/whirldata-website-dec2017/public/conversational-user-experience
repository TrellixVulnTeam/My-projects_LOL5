			<p>Organizations have collected large amount of data in the last
				few years. And they continue to collect. The quantity of data
				increases everyday and the quality and the throughput of processing
				has ept up with the rate of data collection. Machine learning
				algorithms combined with low cost computing power available today
				has allowed advanced and complicated analytics to be run not only on
				the huge data store – but can also include eternal data about the
				users/customers in multiple contexts and harness the power of the
				subjective knowledge.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>However, the power to leverage this knowledge to increase
				engagement with customers is limited – they have been limited to the
				extent to what pre-defined interfaces allow. Interfaces such as
				mobile apps and websites and to a large extent even the salesperson
				on the store are limited by the functionalities already built-in or
				knowledge possessed by an individual l(in the case of a
				salesperson). Pre-defined interfaces are ones whose flow of
				engagement is decided not in real-time</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Conversational user interfaces have answered a critical
				question in the affirmative – or at least have ensured that the
				answer will be a certain yes in the near future. The question is "if
				a customer is allowed a free-flow, non-syntax based interaction with
				the knowledge base of an organization, will it lead to improved
				revenues, loyalty and satisfaction?"</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>CUIs have the capability to link customers with an
				organizations real-time learnings. Much of the talk today has been
				about the availability of voice translation devices such as Echo, OK
				Google, Siri as being the prime driver for increased CUI. However,
				the real power of CUIs resides in being able to increase
				free-flowing non-syntactical engagement with customers through
				channels that they are familiar with. The modes of engagement could
				be a website, an app or a voice assistant or a chatbot.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Whirldata understands the immense value CUIs offer and focuses
				its offerings on enabling organizations to leverage their
				knowledge-base to engage in real-time with customers. In the
				endeavor to build CUIs, Whirldata has broken down its capability
				offerings into the following pieces that together enable an
				effective CUI deployment for an organization:</p>
			<br> <br>
			<li>Ability to effectively use off-the shelf NLP engines and
				also build new ones where required if regional languages/dialetcs
				require so Integration capability with multiple virtual assistants –
				Echo, OK Google, Skype Facebook, Slack
			<li>Customized mobile and web agents as entry points for CUIs
			<li>Ability to deploy AWS’ serverless computing architecture –
				along with hosting in-house at client's site or a could provider of
				choice
			<li>Harness the power of Machine Learning algorithms in a
				commercially meaningful manner to serve the CUIs
