			<p>June 22, 2017 - Whirldata today announced the opening of its
				dedicated new research and development facility, Whirldata Labs, in
				Chennai, India. The early stage data science and intelligent
				computing services startup says a number of scientists along with a
				strong team of developers are already on board and recruitment
				efforts are continuing to grow a strong offshore research and
				services team.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>The Chennai office was inaugurated by Mr. Pravin Shekar –
				Chairman & CEO at Krea. Well wishers and advisers from the
				technology industry graced the occasion. Co-founder and Director of
				DilSeBol.com and Whirldata’s first client, Mr. Ravi Kumar, lit the
				traditional kuthuvilaku. The inauguration was followed by a
				captivating and motivational speech by Mr. Pravin Shekar.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>“The Chennai research lab and delivery center is a natural fit
				to Whirldata’s global strategy to invest in an offshore service
				center in India”, says Ara Ramalingam, founder & CEO of Whirldata, a
				serial entrepreneur and a technologist. “I specialized in Artificial
				Intelligence and Neural Networks during my Masters in Computer
				Science in 1999. The computing power needed to run these systems in
				a commercially viable manner has become a recent possibility and the
				market demand for these services is seeing a steep growth. Our core
				offering at Whirldata is our expertise in bridging the technology
				gap, between the lab and the office desk, by building solutions for
				the industry using the latest intelligent platforms and tools from
				all leading vendors. Our offering range from building analytical
				solutions on IoT data to building deep learning neural networks and
				training them on highly parallel GPUs. With the new office space, we
				are also looking to build a dedicated training team to enhance the
				skills required, for our new recruits, in linear algebra, calculus,
				linguistic analysis and knowledge engineering.”</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>“With the changing market need in the field of intelligent
				computing, candidates with just a computer science engineering
				degree no longer fits the bill. The new breed of engineers and
				researchers are required to have a strong mathematical foundation”,
				says Nisanth Nair, Whirldata’s VP of Human Resources. “Chennai, with
				its closeness to reputed educational and research institutions and
				its tradition of asserting the importance of strong foundations in
				core sciences is a hot bed of resources required for the paradigm
				shift the technology industry is going through. The new office will
				provide us the much needed space for growth in team size and also to
				setup some of the research labs.”</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>“The startup was nurtured in the dining room of Ara’s two
				bedroom house before moving to his slightly larger basement”, says
				Muthupandian Thangarajan (Mu), co-founder and Director of Technology
				at Whirldata. “I am very excited about the new office space and the
				opportunity to grow the team. We recently built a proof of concept,
				Sodabot, to showcase the integration of automation, virtual
				assistants, nutrition and healthcare and had to borrow resources
				across multiple teams to get the prototype to run. We have several
				new projects in the pipeline and have been short of space to grow
				the team to handle the needs.”</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>“We worked with the Whirldata team for re-launching our
				website, www.DilSeBol.com with embedded machine learning algorithms
				to study consumer behavior and site usage. Whirldata understood
				where we were at, where we wanted to go and recommended a solution
				that was suitable for us both in terms of functionality and budget.
				The team has been professional in their approach and so far, we have
				been satisfied with the way the project has been handled. We look
				forward to working together more in future as we foresee a lot of
				ways in which the Whirldata team can add value to our e-commerce
				venture” say Ravi Kumar, co-founder and Director of DilSeBol.com.
				DilSeBol.com is the first client to integrate Whirldata’s AptEngine,
				a product recommendation engine, designed and built by their Chennai
				team. The service offering to DilSeBol.com includes various machine
				learning based solution strategies and architecture to accommodate
				conversational user interfaces and virtual assistants in the future.
