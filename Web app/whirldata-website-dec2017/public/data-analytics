			<p>Whirldata understands the power of using the right approach to
				extract relevant insights from an accruing pile of data. It has been
				known and accepted for the last several years that Business
				analytics and business intelligence solutions can help improve the
				decision-making capabilities of organizations, cut costs and
				identify new business opportunities.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>In addition, with many organizations starting to explore and
				deploy Machine Learning based solutions, Data Analytics as a field
				of offering has taken on a more important role as the first step in
				the development of any Machine Learning system is the ability to
				visualize existing data. The right kind of visualization
				significantly impacts the performance and accuracy of ML systems.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Data Analytics, hence, is critical from 2 aspects â€“ one by
				itself and another by ensuring that expensive and powerful ML
				systems that are built perform optimally when deployed. So any
				effort at building and deploying analytical tools/solutions requires
				the in-depth understanding of the business drivers that have led an
				organization to consider the possibility of expanding the use of
				data analytics tools/solutions.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>We, at Whirldata, always begin all our engagement with our
				valuable customers by delving into the underlying business case and
				then employ the use of the right tools/packages or custom-build a
				new one from scratch. We look upon every engagement as a consulting
				engagement irrespective of what the commercial models maybe and
				ensure that we impart as much value in the development/deployment
				process.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Once have a good insight of the business case, we choose the
				right tool/combinations of tools/custom build solutions for Data
				Gathering, Cleansing, Integrating, Analyzing, Presenting and sharing
				of data. Our team of data analysts and scientists constantly explore
				various packagaes and databases and can advice on the optimal
				combinations.</p>

				Python

			<li>Qlik
