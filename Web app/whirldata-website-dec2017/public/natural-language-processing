			<p>NLP is the application of AI to understand human language as
				its spoken/written. Historically humans have interacted with
				computers using "languages" that computers can understand. These
				languages are highly structured, precise and devoid of ambiguity.
				While computers using such languages have brought about tremendous
				social and economical benefits, as we are seeing all around us, use
				of computers have always been limited when it came to applications
				that required understanding of written and spoken human language as
				its normally done between two humans.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>For instance, while databases have evolved in different
				branches and their storing and retrieval and speeds, method of
				organization, processing time and several other aspects have
				improved manifolds, it still requires the use of syntactical
				"languages" to manipulate the databases (add, retrieve, update,
				etc.). Would it not be nice if a human can write/speak a statement
				that can directly query a database and expect the query to be
				translated correctly? This is one such situation where NLP comes is.

			<br> <br>
			<p>You could ponder over the following:</p>
			<li>How would it be if a computer can understand your mood from
				your tone and sentence construction?</li>
			<li>How would it be if you could automate your entire customer
				service/support mechanism (which are anyways being done) and do so
				with emotions (sympathy, empathy and concesrn)?</li>
			<li>How would it be if you could have documents sent to you
				automatically processed and just the “intent” conveyed to you?
				Imagine the reduction in the number of legal and contractual
				documents that you have to read as part of your work life?</li>
			<li>How would it be if while you were in the midst of your
				household chores, talk to an “agent” that can help you plan a
				holiday like a expert and have your tickets booked?</li>
			<br> <p>The applications are endless...</p>

			<p>Whirldata understands that NLP is a fledgling concept but with
				a very valuable application potential. Whirldata ensures a sustained
				in-house Research and Development effort for building NLP-based
				products/solutions in the financial/retail/energy/healthcare/legal
				domain. Some products that are in the pipeline - Deep/Shallow
				Question Answering, Search, ChatBots to enable various operational
				tasks, client assistance based on inferred client needs, Virtual
				Assistant to sales teams and advisors/consultants.</p>
			<br> <br>
			<p>Every member of Whirldata’s NLP development/testing team is
				very curious, possess an outstanding sense of humour, possess the
				inherent ability to share knowledge on a sustained basis and of
				course technically sound. After all they need to indulge in hours
				and hours of conversations with the inanimate!</p>
